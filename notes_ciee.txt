4 mechanisms for network-area relationship

- sampling: more species, different constraints on the distribution of the links (use the niche model to make the predictions)

- extinction-area: the ttib prediction


- beta-diversity in species composition


- beta-diversity in the links


- multidimensional way of controlling for the properties
	- e.g. S, C, 

- 
 

-- underlying drivers: spatial distribution of traits/phylogeny

##
Network alignment:
 
solution to the alignment of multiple networks would be to align them to a 'latent network' 


## 
Contribution to beta diversity:
- evaluate the contribution of each node to different properties (e.g. stability, network property, species beta diversity, network beta diversity)

-  







### USE THE PROBABILISTIC APPROACH TO EVALUATE CHANGE IN NETWORK PROPERTIES ALONG A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT
- controlling for co-occurrence and for the impact of temperature on the metaweb
- evaluate where the changes are the most important (dependence on temperature of the changes)
